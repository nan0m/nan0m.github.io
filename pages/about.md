# Hi, I am Fabian. I am a game development generalist.


<img class="circular" src="assets/img/pages/about/picture_of_me_cropped.jpg" width="400"/>


I made my first game [Clerica](/projects/Clerica) with the pygame framework, since then I have learned a ton.
I love making shaders and tools, and have been steadily learning more about the
jobs of technical artists. (I am also a sucker for Philosophy, especially Media Theory)

Currently I am working on a bigger project, a tiny open world game called [Towers](/projects/Towers)
