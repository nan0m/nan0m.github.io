I learned about the very prevalent condition of [Alexithymia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia),
which is the difficulty of identifying and describing one's own or other's emotions. 
I knew that journaling was an effective practicing method against this, as well as that
emotion wheels exist to remedy that.
Consequently, I wanted to create a journaling app, that nudges one away from Alexithymia by:

- highlighting all feelings one types into the journal
- providing a dropdown that helps identify ever more precisely what one is feeling.
- making available a body map, where one can cross-reference _where_ in the
body one feels an emotion, with what emotion that probably is.
