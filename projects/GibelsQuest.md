Gibels Quest was my first 3D game. It surprised us when we found out that it had largely become a walking simulator,
however, I have rarely been able to forgot my stresses and worries as much as when I am playing Gibel's Quest.
It's really unique because of the way Leon built up the atmosphere through the sound design, and I am in love with it
like none other of my games.
