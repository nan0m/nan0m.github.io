3-sections / default.sass to set the default font background color and so on! this is just for the default theme
all.sass you can actually set it, this is the most base thing I think


The code for embedding a local video is

<video width="100%" preload="auto" muted controls>
    <source src="assets\videos\test_vid.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

because chrome wont let videos that have sound play standard you have to have muted maybe to have it work on all possible devices
